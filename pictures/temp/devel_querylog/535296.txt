For restaurants, Facebook users will be able to make reservations directly on their pages following an integration with online real-time restaurant-reservation service OpenTable, eliminating the need to visit the mobile sites of the approximately 20,000 U.S. restaurants that support OpenTable, or to launch the OpenTable application. <strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/tomiogeron\/2013\/08\/12\/facebook-moves-into-local-with-opentable-restaurant-bookings\/\"><em>Forbes<\/em><\/a><\/strong> Facebook is also adding television listings on its mobile app. For TV shows and movies that have a Facebook page, those pages will now display the next local time and TV channel it is playing.

Just last month, Yelp launched a slightly similar feature that aims to get its users to take action. The Yelp platform works with Delivery.com and Eat24 to let users order food for delivery or pickup.

Prior to his education at NYU, Groman spent two years working at mobile development studio Afroes in South Africa and Kenya, where he\u00a0built applications for campaigning and education.<br \/>\n\u00a0<br \/>\nNew Career Opportunities Daily: The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mediabistro.com\/joblistings\/?c=rss\">best jobs in media<\/a>.<br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/~ff\/socialtimes?a=2Byk65h_oCI:Y9Pgu4KvX_Y:pnQdOprp5To\"><\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/~ff\/socialtimes?a=2Byk65h_oCI:Y9Pgu4KvX_Y:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/~ff\/socialtimes?a=2Byk65h_oCI:Y9Pgu4KvX_Y:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><\/a><\/p>\n","safe_summary":""}]},"field_vote":[],"rdf_mapping":{"rdftype":["sioc:Item","foaf:Document"],"title":{"predicates":["dc:title"]},"created":{"predicates":["dc:date","dc:created"],"datatype":"xsd:dateTime","callback":"date_iso8601"},"changed":{"predicates":["dc:modified"],"datatype":"xsd:dateTime","callback":"date_iso8601"},"body":{"predicates":["content:encoded"]},"uid":{"predicates":["sioc:has_creator"],"type":"rel"},"name":{"predicates":["foaf:name"]},"comment_count":{"predicates":["sioc:num_replies"],"datatype":"xsd:integer"},"last_activity":{"predicates":["sioc:last_activity_date"],"datatype":"xsd:dateTime","callback":"date_iso8601"}},"cid":"0","last_comment_timestamp":"1376353295","last_comment_name":null,"last_comment_uid":"0","comment_count":"0","name":"","picture":"0","data":null,"user_relationship_node_access":false},"9066":{"vid":"9066","uid":"0","title":"Lost in Translation: Speaking Your Solar Customer\u2019s Language","log":"Created by FeedsNodeProcessor","status":"1","comment":"2","promote":"0","sticky":"0","nid":"9066","type":"feed_item","language":"und","created":"1376319120","changed":"1376353295","tnid":"0","translate":"0","revision_timestamp":"1376353295","revision_uid":"0","field_feed_item_description":{"und":[{"value":"<img hspace=\"10\" vspace=\"5\" align=\"left\" width=\"110\" src=\"http:\/\/www.renewableenergyworld.com\/\/assets\/images\/story\/2013\/8\/12\/feature-0-1376319068637.png\" \/> It\u2019s often said that you can make only one first impression.

Forever. Which is pretty much what happened when Gmail added its new tabs. For most people, the change wasn\u2019t really a big deal. In fact, believe it or not, some people, actually liked the new changes. Here are 5 reasons the \u00a0new Gmail doesn\u2019t suck as much as people think.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>1. \u00a0Fewer ads. Even though Groupon is stalking you.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The ads from Target, Groupon, ShoeDazzle, and all of the other retailers you have been meaning to unsubscribe from but haven\u2019t, appear magically under the Promotions tab. This is nice because you can choose to look at them later without having to weed through them to get to your important emails. You may actually shop less if you ignore that tab altogether. Retailers know this, by the way, and have been sending out SOS messages letting you know you might miss out on something tragically important if you don\u2019t move them over to the Primary tab. Nice try guys, but no thanks.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>2. \u00a0Move email messages to the Primary tab. If you want to.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sure, some of your messages may appear under the wrong tab and wreak havoc on your inbox. Fortunately, if this happens, you simply need to move the message to the tab it should appear in, by right-clicking on the email, hovering over \u201cmove to tab\u201d, and then choosing the tab you want the email to appear in. Or, you can just drag and drop the message. At the top, you\u2019ll see a message that says \u201cdo this for future messages from ___@__.com?\u201d (Here, you\u2019ll click \u2018yes\u2019).<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>3. \u00a0Round Up Twitter, Facebook, Linkedin notifications. For whatever.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Until we figure out if we will ever need every notification that Ben tagged you on Facebook, or Susan updated her skills on LinkedIn, we can store them all under the Social tab. If you happen to have all of your social media notifications turned off, you probably won\u2019t have anything in this tab anyway. For the rest of us who suffer from unrealistic attachment to email disorders, it\u2019s a lifesaver.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>4. \u00a0Delete the whole tab to clean up mail.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you\u2019re like me, you\u2019re hanging on to a bunch of email messages just because you think you may need every one of those 60,000 messages one day. Anyone who has ever tried to go through and clean up a mailbox with thousands of messages will tell you it\u2019s downright exhausting and usually ends up a failed mission after the first couple pages.

Forever. Which is pretty much what happened when Gmail added its new tabs. For most people, the change wasn\u2019t really a big deal. In fact, believe it or not, some people, actually liked the new changes. Here are 5 reasons the \u00a0new Gmail doesn\u2019t suck as much as people think.<br \/><strong>1. \u00a0Fewer ads. Even though Groupon is stalking you.<\/strong><br \/>\nThe ads from Target, Groupon, ShoeDazzle, and all of the other retailers you have been meaning to unsubscribe from but haven\u2019t, appear magically under the Promotions tab. This is nice because you can choose to look at them later without having to weed through them to get to your important emails. You may actually shop less if you ignore that tab altogether. Retailers know this, by the way, and have been sending out SOS messages letting you know you might miss out on something tragically important if you don\u2019t move them over to the Primary tab. Nice try guys, but no thanks.<br \/><strong>2. \u00a0Move email messages to the Primary tab. If you want to.<\/strong><br \/>\nSure, some of your messages may appear under the wrong tab and wreak havoc on your inbox. Fortunately, if this happens, you simply need to move the message to the tab it should appear in, by right-clicking on the email, hovering over \u201cmove to tab\u201d, and then choosing the tab you want the email to appear in. Or, you can just drag and drop the message. At the top, you\u2019ll see a message that says \u201cdo this for future messages from <a href=\"mailto:___@__.com\">___@__.com<\/a>?\u201d (Here, you\u2019ll click \u2018yes\u2019).<br \/><strong>3. \u00a0Round Up Twitter, Facebook, Linkedin notifications. For whatever.<\/strong><br \/>\nUntil we figure out if we will ever need every notification that Ben tagged you on Facebook, or Susan updated her skills on LinkedIn, we can store them all under the Social tab. If you happen to have all of your social media notifications turned off, you probably won\u2019t have anything in this tab anyway. For the rest of us who suffer from unrealistic attachment to email disorders, it\u2019s a lifesaver.<br \/><strong>4. \u00a0Delete the whole tab to clean up mail.<\/strong><br \/>\nIf you\u2019re like me, you\u2019re hanging on to a bunch of email messages just because you think you may need every one of those 60,000 messages one day. Anyone who has ever tried to go through and clean up a mailbox with thousands of messages will tell you it\u2019s downright exhausting and usually ends up a failed mission after the first couple pages. The new tabs however, allow the opportunity to delete literally thousands of emails in one fell swoop. You will never need that Best Buy ad from 2010. I promise.<br \/><strong>5. \u00a0You can change back to old Gmail.<\/strong><br \/>\nAs a last resort, and if you just can\u2019t see the awesomeness of the new Gmail, you do have the option to revert back to the old style, sans tabs. To change your mail box back to old Gmail, click the \u201c+\u201d at the end of the tab headings and uncheck every tab box except for the one that says \u201cPrimary\u201d.

Forever. Which is pretty much what happened when Gmail added its new tabs. For most people, the change wasn\u2019t really a big deal. In fact, believe it or not, some people, actually liked the new changes. Here are 5 reasons the \u00a0new Gmail doesn\u2019t suck as much as people think.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>1. \u00a0Fewer ads. Even though Groupon is stalking you.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The ads from Target, Groupon, ShoeDazzle, and all of the other retailers you have been meaning to unsubscribe from but haven\u2019t, appear magically under the Promotions tab. This is nice because you can choose to look at them later without having to weed through them to get to your important emails. You may actually shop less if you ignore that tab altogether. Retailers know this, by the way, and have been sending out SOS messages letting you know you might miss out on something tragically important if you don\u2019t move them over to the Primary tab. Nice try guys, but no thanks.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>2. \u00a0Move email messages to the Primary tab. If you want to.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sure, some of your messages may appear under the wrong tab and wreak havoc on your inbox. Fortunately, if this happens, you simply need to move the message to the tab it should appear in, by right-clicking on the email, hovering over \u201cmove to tab\u201d, and then choosing the tab you want the email to appear in. Or, you can just drag and drop the message. At the top, you\u2019ll see a message that says \u201cdo this for future messages from ___@__.com?\u201d (Here, you\u2019ll click \u2018yes\u2019).<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>3. \u00a0Round Up Twitter, Facebook, Linkedin notifications. For whatever.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Until we figure out if we will ever need every notification that Ben tagged you on Facebook, or Susan updated her skills on LinkedIn, we can store them all under the Social tab. If you happen to have all of your social media notifications turned off, you probably won\u2019t have anything in this tab anyway. For the rest of us who suffer from unrealistic attachment to email disorders, it\u2019s a lifesaver.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>4. \u00a0Delete the whole tab to clean up mail.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you\u2019re like me, you\u2019re hanging on to a bunch of email messages just because you think you may need every one of those 60,000 messages one day. Anyone who has ever tried to go through and clean up a mailbox with thousands of messages will tell you it\u2019s downright exhausting and usually ends up a failed mission after the first couple pages.

Forever. Which is pretty much what happened when Gmail added its new tabs. For most people, the change wasn\u2019t really a big deal. In fact, believe it or not, some people, actually liked the new changes. Here are 5 reasons the \u00a0new Gmail doesn\u2019t suck as much as people think.<br \/><strong>1. \u00a0Fewer ads. Even though Groupon is stalking you.<\/strong><br \/>\nThe ads from Target, Groupon, ShoeDazzle, and all of the other retailers you have been meaning to unsubscribe from but haven\u2019t, appear magically under the Promotions tab. This is nice because you can choose to look at them later without having to weed through them to get to your important emails. You may actually shop less if you ignore that tab altogether. Retailers know this, by the way, and have been sending out SOS messages letting you know you might miss out on something tragically important if you don\u2019t move them over to the Primary tab. Nice try guys, but no thanks.<br \/><strong>2. \u00a0Move email messages to the Primary tab. If you want to.<\/strong><br \/>\nSure, some of your messages may appear under the wrong tab and wreak havoc on your inbox. Fortunately, if this happens, you simply need to move the message to the tab it should appear in, by right-clicking on the email, hovering over \u201cmove to tab\u201d, and then choosing the tab you want the email to appear in. Or, you can just drag and drop the message. At the top, you\u2019ll see a message that says \u201cdo this for future messages from <a href=\"mailto:___@__.com\">___@__.com<\/a>?\u201d (Here, you\u2019ll click \u2018yes\u2019).<br \/><strong>3. \u00a0Round Up Twitter, Facebook, Linkedin notifications. For whatever.<\/strong><br \/>\nUntil we figure out if we will ever need every notification that Ben tagged you on Facebook, or Susan updated her skills on LinkedIn, we can store them all under the Social tab. If you happen to have all of your social media notifications turned off, you probably won\u2019t have anything in this tab anyway. For the rest of us who suffer from unrealistic attachment to email disorders, it\u2019s a lifesaver.<br \/><strong>4. \u00a0Delete the whole tab to clean up mail.<\/strong><br \/>\nIf you\u2019re like me, you\u2019re hanging on to a bunch of email messages just because you think you may need every one of those 60,000 messages one day. Anyone who has ever tried to go through and clean up a mailbox with thousands of messages will tell you it\u2019s downright exhausting and usually ends up a failed mission after the first couple pages. The new tabs however, allow the opportunity to delete literally thousands of emails in one fell swoop. You will never need that Best Buy ad from 2010. I promise.<br \/><strong>5. \u00a0You can change back to old Gmail.<\/strong><br \/>\nAs a last resort, and if you just can\u2019t see the awesomeness of the new Gmail, you do have the option to revert back to the old style, sans tabs. To change your mail box back to old Gmail, click the \u201c+\u201d at the end of the tab headings and uncheck every tab box except for the one that says \u201cPrimary\u201d.

Forever. Which is pretty much what happened when Gmail added its new tabs. For most people, the change wasn\u2019t really a big deal. In fact, believe it or not, some people, actually liked the new changes. Here are 5 reasons the \u00a0new Gmail doesn\u2019t suck as much as people think.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>1. \u00a0Fewer ads. Even though Groupon is stalking you.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The ads from Target, Groupon, ShoeDazzle, and all of the other retailers you have been meaning to unsubscribe from but haven\u2019t, appear magically under the Promotions tab. This is nice because you can choose to look at them later without having to weed through them to get to your important emails. You may actually shop less if you ignore that tab altogether. Retailers know this, by the way, and have been sending out SOS messages letting you know you might miss out on something tragically important if you don\u2019t move them over to the Primary tab. Nice try guys, but no thanks.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>2. \u00a0Move email messages to the Primary tab. If you want to.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sure, some of your messages may appear under the wrong tab and wreak havoc on your inbox. Fortunately, if this happens, you simply need to move the message to the tab it should appear in, by right-clicking on the email, hovering over \u201cmove to tab\u201d, and then choosing the tab you want the email to appear in. Or, you can just drag and drop the message. At the top, you\u2019ll see a message that says \u201cdo this for future messages from ___@__.com?\u201d (Here, you\u2019ll click \u2018yes\u2019).<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>3. \u00a0Round Up Twitter, Facebook, Linkedin notifications. For whatever.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Until we figure out if we will ever need every notification that Ben tagged you on Facebook, or Susan updated her skills on LinkedIn, we can store them all under the Social tab. If you happen to have all of your social media notifications turned off, you probably won\u2019t have anything in this tab anyway. For the rest of us who suffer from unrealistic attachment to email disorders, it\u2019s a lifesaver.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>4. \u00a0Delete the whole tab to clean up mail.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you\u2019re like me, you\u2019re hanging on to a bunch of email messages just because you think you may need every one of those 60,000 messages one day. Anyone who has ever tried to go through and clean up a mailbox with thousands of messages will tell you it\u2019s downright exhausting and usually ends up a failed mission after the first couple pages.

Forever. Which is pretty much what happened when Gmail added its new tabs. For most people, the change wasn\u2019t really a big deal. In fact, believe it or not, some people, actually liked the new changes. Here are 5 reasons the \u00a0new Gmail doesn\u2019t suck as much as people think.<br \/><strong>1. \u00a0Fewer ads. Even though Groupon is stalking you.<\/strong><br \/>\nThe ads from Target, Groupon, ShoeDazzle, and all of the other retailers you have been meaning to unsubscribe from but haven\u2019t, appear magically under the Promotions tab. This is nice because you can choose to look at them later without having to weed through them to get to your important emails. You may actually shop less if you ignore that tab altogether. Retailers know this, by the way, and have been sending out SOS messages letting you know you might miss out on something tragically important if you don\u2019t move them over to the Primary tab. Nice try guys, but no thanks.<br \/><strong>2. \u00a0Move email messages to the Primary tab. If you want to.<\/strong><br \/>\nSure, some of your messages may appear under the wrong tab and wreak havoc on your inbox. Fortunately, if this happens, you simply need to move the message to the tab it should appear in, by right-clicking on the email, hovering over \u201cmove to tab\u201d, and then choosing the tab you want the email to appear in. Or, you can just drag and drop the message. At the top, you\u2019ll see a message that says \u201cdo this for future messages from <a href=\"mailto:___@__.com\">___@__.com<\/a>?\u201d (Here, you\u2019ll click \u2018yes\u2019).<br \/><strong>3. \u00a0Round Up Twitter, Facebook, Linkedin notifications. For whatever.<\/strong><br \/>\nUntil we figure out if we will ever need every notification that Ben tagged you on Facebook, or Susan updated her skills on LinkedIn, we can store them all under the Social tab. If you happen to have all of your social media notifications turned off, you probably won\u2019t have anything in this tab anyway. For the rest of us who suffer from unrealistic attachment to email disorders, it\u2019s a lifesaver.<br \/><strong>4. \u00a0Delete the whole tab to clean up mail.<\/strong><br \/>\nIf you\u2019re like me, you\u2019re hanging on to a bunch of email messages just because you think you may need every one of those 60,000 messages one day. Anyone who has ever tried to go through and clean up a mailbox with thousands of messages will tell you it\u2019s downright exhausting and usually ends up a failed mission after the first couple pages. The new tabs however, allow the opportunity to delete literally thousands of emails in one fell swoop. You will never need that Best Buy ad from 2010. I promise.<br \/><strong>5. \u00a0You can change back to old Gmail.<\/strong><br \/>\nAs a last resort, and if you just can\u2019t see the awesomeness of the new Gmail, you do have the option to revert back to the old style, sans tabs. To change your mail box back to old Gmail, click the \u201c+\u201d at the end of the tab headings and uncheck every tab box except for the one that says \u201cPrimary\u201d.
